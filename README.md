Code for the renderer that myself and a fellow student created for our joint Computer Graphics pair coursework at the University of Bristol in out Third year. Mark achieved - 80% (1st)

Below is a list of features that are included in the renderer. Although both a rasteriser and raytracer were implemented, most of the advanced lighting, material, and shadowing features were implemented for the raytracer only.

1. OBJ file loading (geometery and materials)               &#9745;
1. Wireframe rendering                                      &#9745;
1. Flat shaded rasterising                                  &#9745;
1. Moving camera (position only)                            &#9745;
1. Saving of PPM Files                                      &#9745;
1. Changing camera orientation (via orientation matrix)     &#9745;
1. Generative geometery (using diamond square algorithm)    &#9745;
1. Ambient lighting                                         &#9745;
1. Diffuse lighting (proximity an angle-of-incidence)       &#9745;
1. Hard Shadows                                             &#9745;
1. Gouraud shading                                          &#9745;
1. Naive (non-perspective corrected) texture mapping        &#9745;
1. Camera, lighting, and model animations                   &#9745;  
1. Basic culling / clipping (far-plane, near-plane, back-face)&#9745;
1. Phong shading                                            &#9745;     
1. Mirror, Glass and Metal materials                        &#9745;
1. Complex anti-aliasing  (8xMSAA)                          &#9745;
1. Perspective corrected texture mapping                    &#9745;
1. Basic clipping (bounding box)                            &#9745;
1. Line drawing optimisations (e.g. Bresenham)              &#9745;
1. Advanced clipping (Frustram)                             &#9745;
